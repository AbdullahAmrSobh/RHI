Fix swapchain
Imporve RenderGraph API
Ensure there are no memory or resource leaks in the codebase
Cleanup API
    - Remove unused functions, variables, unnecessary includes, Includes, etc.
    - Improve UsageFlags, make unified model

NOTES:
    - ShaderModule is a pointer, maybe Pipeline<T>CreateInfo should take raw pointer to shader byte code instead?
    Too much API noise, Function that create/destroy doesn't match in signatures.
    - The texture to buffer and buffer to texture copy interface should be simplified a bit.
    - BlitImage is not portable for WebGPU and D3D12 APIs
    - ImageSubresourcesX are too many and redundnt probably don't need all of these?
Scene:
    - Mesh
    - Material
