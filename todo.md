- keep backend implementation details local to the backend, (do not modify the frontend)
- backend resource destruction is an implementation detail
- interfaces should be simple, all info structs should be POD creation using initializer lists
- validate info structs in front end
- move leak detector to a leak allocator (and make sure that integerate into handle pool)
- add scheduler interface for scheduling GPU workloads
- use TL::String for owning a reference to a string, and const char* for a string views
- add command list allocator class
    - command list mangment
    - reset whole pool
    - create and free constantly (after submit)
- add explict commands to command list (e.g. BindBuffer, BindPipeline ...etc)
- add temp allocator
- resources outside render graph are synced using wait groups (bind group will subscribe to a wait group) (binding that bind group means that the command list using that resource is in flight)
