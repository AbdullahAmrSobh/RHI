Fix deletion queue
Fix swapchain
Imporve RenderGraph API
Ensure there are no memory or resource leaks in the codebase
Cleanup API
    - Remove unused functions, variables, unnecessary includes, Includes, etc.
    - Improve UsageFlags, make unified model

NOTES:
    ShaderModule is a pointer, maybe Pipeline<T>CreateInfo should take raw pointer to shader byte code instead?
    Too much API noise, Function that create/destroy doesn't match in signatures.


Scene:
    - Mesh
    - Material
    - Texture
